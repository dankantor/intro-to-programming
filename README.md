### Introduction

When we visit a webpage such as http://google.com, our web browser is asking the server at google.com to return the webpage. The server responds with the webpage which consists of HTML, CSS and Javascript.&#x20;

HTML contains the contents of the website. On google.com this is the google logo, search box and some buttons.

CSS contains information on how to style the HTML. This is where each element (logo, box, buttons) belongs and what they look like (color, size, etc).

Javascript controls the interactivity of the webpage. In this case, it controls what happens when you tap the 'Search' button.&#x20;

### Lesson

In order to complete this course, students should create a free [CodePen](https://codepen.io) account. Each lesson will have examples that should be typed directly into CodePen. Students are encouraged to save their work each week in a new Pen.&#x20;
